    The first book printed in English in North America. The
    version of the Psalms was made about the year 1636, the
    principal divines of the country each translating a
    portion. The principal part of the work was committed to
    Mr. Richard Mather, minister of the church in Dorchester,
    who probably wrote the preface also, and to Mr. Thomas Weld
    and Mr. John Eliot, associate ministers of the church in
    Roxbury. The work of printing was completed in 1640, and
    the new Psalm book was adopted at once by nearly every
    congregation in the colony of Massachusetts Bay, and for
    that reason it came to be known as the Bay Psalm book. Of

    “The following extracts are from a poem entitled
    <cite>Democracy</cite>, the first canto of which was printed
    in New-York, in March, 1794, and at the time excited no
    inconsiderable share of the public attention. This poem was
    written in consequence of a tumultuous meeting of the citizens
    of that place, instigated by a few popular demagogues, for the
    purpose of prescribing to Congress the adoption of hostile
    measures against Great Britain. The second canto, which was of
    much greater length, was prepared for the press immediately
    after the appearance of the first, but the timidity of the
    booksellers, and the peculiar circumstances of the times
    prevented its publication.”</p>

    “A free parody of the <cite>Lay of the last minstrel</cite>....
    The production is principally devoted to satirizing the
    predatory warfare of the British on Chesapeake Bay, and, what is
    somewhat remarkable, was published in a very handsome style in
    London with a preface highly complimentary to the author. The
    hero is Admiral Cockburn, and the principal incident the burning
    and sacking of the little town of Havre de Grace on the coast
    of Maryland. It had at that time what might be called the
    distinction of provoking a fierce review from the London
    Quarterly. It is clever as a parody, and contains many passages
